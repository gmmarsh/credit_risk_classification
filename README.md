## Introduction
Credit risk classification is an important task in the financial industry. Lenders need to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers to make informed decisions about granting loans. This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately classify borrowers as low risk or high risk based on their credit profiles.

## Data
The dataset used for this project consists of historical credit data, including various features such as income, loan size, interest rate, debt-to-income, and credit history amongst others. The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.

## Methodology
The credit risk classification model is developed using machine learning techniques. Logistic regression was used to classify the loan as healthy or high-risk. The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Results
The performance of the credit risk classification model is assessed based on various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results are presented and analyzed to determine the effectiveness of the model in predicting credit risk.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/gmmarsh/credit_risk_classification.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `credit_risk_classification.ipynb`
